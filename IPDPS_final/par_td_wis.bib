  discussed.  One of the key points here is that extendibility can be proven for planar graphs in much
  wider context - the ratcatcher algorithm can be used to check whether or not a decomposition is extendible,
  whereas in the general, non-planar case, once we make the first "non-safe" splitting of a partial
  decomposition, we have no way of knowing the extendibility any more.  As in the ratcatcher paper,
  the medial graph is used - running times are smaller, but for some reason he doesn't run the algorithm

  provide a ``certificate'' of its optimality in the form of a tangle basis.  In other words, given
  a graph and a decomposition of width $k$, the algorithm either returns an improved decomposition
  of width at most $k-1$ or it gives you a lower bound on the branchwidth of $k$ by returning
  a tangle basis of order $k$.  Computational results on graphs containing up to about 1000 edges with
  at most 750 nodes show very wildly varying runtimes - from 0.1 seconds up to 20 hours for graphs
  with similar numbers of nodes and edges.  All results involve initial decompositions with width $\le$ 8.
  Would be interesting to see if it could improve the decompositions of the TSP-Delaunay triangulated
  graphs discussed in Cook-Seymour TSP paper, but I suspect that running time would be a killer.
  Should look at algorithm in some detail to see if there are options for parallelization.
